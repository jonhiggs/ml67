## Columns

Start with the rows. It's best to get them done while there aren't too many wires crossing the board.

Next, we need to do the columns. They are simple as. Find any point on the board the label you want and solder it in place.

At this point, they keyboard is completely compatible with the original controller. You could just remove the jumpers from the header, plug in the original and everything should work as it did.

If you are happy, you can either leave the jumpers in place, or better, solder some permanent jumpers to the board to merge the rows. Once that is done, the original controller will no longer work.
