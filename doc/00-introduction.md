# Introduction

This document is how to take a standard Filco Minila and upgrade it with T.M.K. firmware.

I've done this once before with the ML62 project. The difference with the ML62 is that I customised the build to be very specific to my own needs. I removed keys and then joined the rows together. Basically in doing that I made it impossible for someone to use my project without making the same drastic customisations.

Also, I retrospectively tried to document the project a long time after most of the work was done. Hence, the documentation isn't what I'd like it to be.

I'm modifying some of the decisions I made in the first attempt because they turned out to be bad decisions. I later decided that I wanted some keys back that I removed right at the beginning. It was virtually impossible to reverse that design decision.

I'm going to document the process as I go. If you stumble upon this documentation, double-check that there is enough information contained for you to complete the project. I'll remove this paragraph once I'm finished.

Now, it's time to get started.
