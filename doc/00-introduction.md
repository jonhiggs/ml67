# Introduction

This document is how to take a standard Filco Minila and upgrade it with T.M.K. firmware.

I've done this once before with the ML62 project. The difference between this and the ML62 is that I customised the build to be very specific to my own needs. I removed keys and then joined the rows together. Basically in doing that I made it impossible for someone to use my project without making the same drastic customisations.

Also, I retrospectively tried to document the project a long time after most of the work was done. Hence, the documentation isn't what I'd like it to be.

I'm modifying some of the design decisions I made in the first attempt. In this project I'm not going to remove any keys from the keymap. That way at any point I can always add them back in if I choose. Something that was not possible with ML62.

I'm documenting the process as I go. If you stumble upon this documentation. If you find any mistakes, please let me know.

Now, it's time to get started.
