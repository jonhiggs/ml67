# Introduction

This document is how to take a standard Filco Minila and upgrade it with TMK firmware.

I've done this once before with the ML62 project. The difference between this and the ML62 is that I customised the build to be very specific to my own needs. I removed keys and then joined the rows together. In doing that I made it impossible for someone to use my project without making the same drastic customisations.

I discovered that my drastic customisations backfired and made it impossible for me to add keys back in. In this project I'm not going to remove any keys from the keymap. It will mean that more pins will be used but that's a better compromise.

With the ML62, I retrospectively tried to document the project a long time after most of the work was done. Hence, the documentation was never as good as I wanted it to be.

I'm documenting the process of this build as I go and should be accurate. If you find any mistakes, please let me know.

## Tools and Stuff

- Filco Minila (I'm using Matrix Ver1.0 2012/10/17. I can't guarantee that anything else will work).
- Teensy 2
- Wire. Red, black and four other colours of your choice.
- Mini USB cable.
- Soldering Iron
- Wire Cutters
- Screwdrivers

To give you an idea on how long it should take. If you are going to use the original casing and an unmodified firmware, I would expect that you should get it done in a day.

Good luck in your own ML67 build.
